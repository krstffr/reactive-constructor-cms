 
 ☐ Write tests!!!

 ☐ The god damn name!!!!

 ☐ Create a separate package for this!

 ☐ Security
   ☐ Require user to be logged in to do anything? (Should probably be setable! true by default)

 ☐ Saving of data:
   ☐ Avoid 1000000000 backups per "main doc"
 
 ☐ Main UI! 
   ☐ The look and feel of this thing. 
   ☐ Also: how does the user reach the UI?
     ☐ No router!!
     ☐ Maybe the user can add a {{> HERE }} wherever she wants to have it?

 ☐ Fetching of data from DB
   ☐ UI
     ☐ Make is a list instead of buttons! See the problem which arose in Matryoshka. Not good!
   ☐ How to handle the "problem" of getting a DB object in multiple places, which created multiple instances of the same data?
      Keep it all in one place as defined by the plugin? Sort of like a global place for all reactive instances fetched from this plugin?
      ☐ Now there is a method for this, just pass constructor name and _id. Works right??
      ☐ Also use this for populating the list when selecting what part to add.
 
 ☐ Global filter method for filtering in lists etc.

 ☐ Ability to filter for specific type (within a constructor) when defining what can be "nested" in an instance. For example: maybe a pagePart only should be able to have nested pagePart->images, and not pagePart->menuItems. Etc.

 ☐ Handling of various input types, text/textarea/disabled/select etc.
   ☐ Select boxes: this needs extra special attention I guess?

 ☐ What's the best way to get the current data context in the blur/update value event? Right now using Template.currentData() which means we have to add this event and method to every unique template we might come up with. Not cool!

 ☐ How to handle nested "pure" objects? Should that even be allowed? NAH. Not in the CMS! Or? Maybe…

 ✔ Handle deletes @done (15-04-30 09:51)
   ☐ Needs security check
   ☐ Only show delet button for docs which are actually saved to DB (not new ones…)

 ☐ Handle links to existing DB objects
   ☐ Updating the link
   ☐ Removing the link

 ☐ Nested list (array) instances with it's own nested lists looks MESSY. Too much going on.

 ☐ Ability to "go to" a nested object.

 ☐ Ability to define how "deep" nested objects should run.
   ☐ Maybe a "load more" button? Or the "go to" ability mentioned above?
